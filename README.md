### Title

Join-Patterns for the Actor Model in Scala 3 using Macros

Join-Patterns til Actor Model i Scala 3 med Makroer

### Description

This project aims to implement actor-based systems with Join Patterns to process messages in Scala 3 by extending the language using its new macro environment. Metaprogramming enabled by macros relies on compile time logic to transform and generate code, that will provide a convenient integration into a codebase by leveraging the pattern-matching mechanism. The resulting artifact will demonstrate a correct and efficient implementation in regard of the existing solutions making use of the Actor model.
